Current review
We are undertaking a retrospective of our work, surveying the relevance of what we have done and reviewing whether there is a need for what we were set up to do.

Proposal 
We would like some help with our logo and website

Despite not having completed our review, we are pretty confident that there is a need for what we do through informal conversations we have had with past participants, the enquiries we have received about when we are going to resume our programmes and by scanning the horizon to see who might be doing similar events and how there are being delivered.

Griot was registered as a charity in 1998 and has been run mostly on volunteering and occasionally with very small grants.  Our governing trust deed can be found on the Charity Commission website https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/1059517/governing-document

Review Survey
We are organising a survey of past and potential participants of our public health forums for women. 

Since our last survey over a decade ago, there have been substantial changes in requirements in research ethics and in laws governing the collection and storage of data.

As a registered charity we have to periodically update the Charity Commission on governance policies on a range of practices including equality, finance, employment, health and safety and others.  We wish to reflect good practice and ensure that we have robust policies in research ethics and data

Given that we are a small, currently unfunded charity, run by volunteers we would like contributions that are proportionate to our needs

The resources we propose to be developed 
Research ethics:  Guidance for a research ethics policy on the surveys we are drafting

Data collection and storage:  Guidance on data collection and storage of the private and personal information that may be gathered by our questionnaires and forum review webinars
